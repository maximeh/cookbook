# Magic Mulled Wine

## Ingrédients

### For one bottle of wine (serves 4)

* 1 bottle of cheap red dry wine
* 1 teacup of sugar (in Brazil we measure everything by the teacup. It's about half a mug)
* 2 cinnamon sticks
* 1 teaspoon of cloves (frankly I add the cinnamon and cloves by feeling, those measures aren't exact).

## Préparation

1. In a large pan, put the sugar, the spices and a teacup of wine (same measure
as the sugar).
2. Turn the heat on and let the mixture boil, stirring occasionally, until it
gets thicker (if you put a drop between two fingers, it should be sticky).
Don't be afraid to let it caramelize a long time, to develop the flavors.
3. When the mixture is thicker, add the rest of the bottle. Turn the heat to a
minimum so the wine can cook slowly.
4. When it starts to boil, let it cook some more minutes and taste It.

If it tastes ok, you can start serving - and drinking!
The procedure is the same for bigger quantities, just double up the ingredients
