# Electrolytes

## Ingredients

This is a copy from LMNT:
https://science.drinklmnt.com/electrolytes/best-homemade-electrolyte-drink-for-dehydration/

* 18oz water (size of my bottle)
* 2500 mg sodium chloride (for 1000 mg sodium)
* 385 mg potassium chloride (for 200 mg potassium)
* 390 mg magnesium malate OR 265 mg di-magnesium malate (for 60 mg magnesium)

## Explanation

1. The sodium is table salt; simply measure it.
2. The potassium comes from salt substitute, I use Morton salt found at Safeway
3. I don't add magnesium because I already take 2x SlowMag daily
4. Add lime (real one) juice if you want flavors
4. Drink it slowly; don't chug it. You'll have an upset stomach otherwise.
