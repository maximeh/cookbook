## Ingredients

* 1 slice of sourdough toast
* 3 eggs

## Directions
1. In a pot; put a dash of water (really little)
2. Put the heat on medium

4. Stir (rubber spatula if you have) continously for 90s
5. Take the pot off the water for 20s while stirring
6. Repeat 4. and 5.
7. Remove the pot from the fire and add some sour cream to stop the cooking (or some more butter - your choice; something cold)
