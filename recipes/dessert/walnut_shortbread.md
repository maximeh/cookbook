# Walnut Shortbread

## Ingredients

* 1 cup of walnut
* 1 cup of butter (melt in in the microwave)
* 1.5 cup of flour
* 1 egg (only the yolk)
* 1/3 cup of sugar
* one tbsp of vanilla extract
* 0.5 tbsp of salt (optional)

## Preparation

1. Start the oven at 350F
2. Put the walnut on a tray for ~10mn
3. In the meantime: Basically mix all your ingredients together.
4. Take the walnut off the oven; but keep it on; then mix them gently (I use pulse lightly to keep some chunk)
5. Incoporate the walnut into your dough
6. Roll the dough or make a ball - depends what shape you want for your biscuits.
7. Shape them on a baking tray (not the one from the walnuts ideally so it's not already hot)
8. Put them in the oven for 10mn
9. Enjoy them while they are still warm (but not burning hot)
